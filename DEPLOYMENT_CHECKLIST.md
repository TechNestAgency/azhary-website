- [x] Performance middleware added

### 2. Build Process
- [x] Vite configuration optimized
- [x] Terser installed for minification
- [x] CSS minification enabled
- [x] Source maps disabled for production

### 3. Image Optimization
- [ ] Run image optimization script: `./optimize-images.sh`
- [ ] Replace original images with optimized versions
- [ ] Update image references in templates
- [ ] Test WebP support

### 4. Server Configuration
- [ ] Enable Gzip/Brotli compression

### 5. Performance Testing
- [ ] Run Google PageSpeed Insights
- [ ] Test on GTmetrix
- [ ] Check Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Test mobile performance

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Build Assets
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Optimize Images
```bash
./optimize-images.sh
```

### Step 3: Update Image References
Replace image paths in templates with optimized versions:
- `hero-back.jpg` → `hero-back-optimized.jpg`
- `presenting.png` → `presenting-optimized.png`
- etc.

### Step 4: Deploy to Server
1. Upload optimized assets
2. Clear server cache
3. Test service worker registration
4. Verify compression is working

### Step 5: Post-Deployment Testing
1. Test homepage loading speed
2. Verify all images load correctly
3. Check service worker functionality
4. Test mobile responsiveness
5. Monitor Core Web Vitals

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization
- Performance Score: 54
- First Contentful Paint: 3.2s
- Largest Contentful Paint: 31.7s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: 0.16

### After Optimization
- Performance Score: 85-95
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1

## Monitoring Setup

### 1. Google Search Console
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Set up alerts for performance issues
- Track mobile usability

### 2. Real User Monitoring
- Set up RUM for performance tracking
- Monitor user experience metrics
- Track conversion rates

### 3. Server Monitoring
- Monitor server response times
- Track error rates
- Monitor resource usage

## Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly
- [ ] Check Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Update service worker if needed

### Monthly
- [ ] Optimize new images
- [ ] Review and remove unused CSS/JS
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Performance audit

### Quarterly
- [ ] Comprehensive performance review
- [ ] Update optimization strategies
- [ ] Review and update service worker
- [ ] Performance budget review

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Service Worker not registering**: Check HTTPS requirement
2. **Images not loading**: Verify lazy loading implementation
3. **CSS not applying**: Check critical CSS inline
4. **JavaScript errors**: Verify async loading order

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check service worker
chrome://serviceworker-internals/

# Test performance
npm run build && npm run dev

# Optimize images
./optimize-images.sh
```

## Performance Budgets

### Core Web Vitals Targets
- FCP: < 1.8s
- LCP: < 2.5s
- CLS: < 0.1
- FID: < 100ms
- TTFB: < 600ms

### Asset Size Limits
- Critical CSS: < 14KB
- Critical JS: < 170KB
- Hero image: < 250KB
- Total page weight: < 1.5MB

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Performance Score: > 85
- Core Web Vitals: All green
- Page load time: < 3s
- Time to interactive: < 3.5s

### Business Metrics
- Bounce rate: < 40%
- Page views per session: > 2
- Conversion rate: Improved
- User engagement: Increased

## Emergency Rollback

If performance issues occur:
1. Disable service worker
2. Revert to original CSS/JS
3. Use original images
4. Remove performance middleware
5. Test and monitor
