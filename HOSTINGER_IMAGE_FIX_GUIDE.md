# ðŸš€ Hostinger Image Fix Guide for Azhary Academy

## ðŸ“‹ Hostinger-Specific Solution

Since you're using Hostinger, here's the correct way to fix your image display issues:

## ðŸ”§ **Step 1: Upload Files via File Manager**

### 1.1 Access Hostinger File Manager
1. Log into your Hostinger control panel
2. Go to **File Manager**
3. Navigate to your domain's `public_html` folder

### 1.2 Upload Image Files
Upload these files to the correct locations:

```
public_html/
â”œâ”€â”€ hero-back.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ presenting.png
â”œâ”€â”€ man2.png
â”œâ”€â”€ man3.png
â”œâ”€â”€ man4.png
â”œâ”€â”€ about.png
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ teachers/

â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [other teacher images]
â””â”€â”€ website_assets/
    â””â”€â”€ img/
        â”œâ”€â”€ logo-no.png
        â”œâ”€â”€ apple-touch-icon.png
        â””â”€â”€ [other assets]
```

## ðŸ”§ **Step 2: Set File Permissions in Hostinger**

### 2.1 Using File Manager
1. In Hostinger File Manager, right-click on each image file
2. Select **Permissions** or **Change Permissions**
3. Set permissions to **644** for all image files
4. Set permissions to **755** for all directories

### 2.2 Using Hostinger's Permission Tool
1. In File Manager, select all image files
2. Click **Permissions** button
3. Set to **644** (Read/Write for owner, Read for group/others)

## ðŸ”§ **Step 3: Upload Test Files**

Upload these diagnostic files I created:

### 3.1 Upload to public_html/
- `test-images.html` - Visual image test
- `check-images.php` - Technical file checker
- `.htaccess` - Server configuration

## ðŸ”§ **Step 4: Test Your Images**

### 4.1 Test URLs
Visit these URLs on your live site:
- `https://azharyfr.com/test-images.html`
- `https://azharyfr.com/check-images.php`

### 4.2 Check Main Site
- `https://azharyfr.com` - Should now show all images

## ðŸ”§ **Step 5: Hostinger-Specific Troubleshooting**

### 5.1 If Images Still Don't Show

#### Check File Paths
In Hostinger File Manager, verify:
- Files are in the correct directories
- File names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- No extra spaces in file names

#### Check .htaccess
1. In File Manager, find `.htaccess` file
2. Right-click â†’ **Edit**
3. Ensure it contains the server-safe configuration I created

#### Check Hostinger Settings
1. Go to **Advanced** â†’ **PHP Configuration**
2. Ensure **mod_rewrite** is enabled
3. Check **Error Logs** for any issues

### 5.2 Common Hostinger Issues

#### Issue 1: File Upload Problems
- **Solution**: Upload files one by one if bulk upload fails
- **Alternative**: Use FTP client (FileZilla) instead of File Manager

#### Issue 2: Permission Issues
- **Solution**: Use Hostinger's permission tool in File Manager
- **Set**: 644 for files, 755 for directories

#### Issue 3: .htaccess Not Working
- **Solution**: Check if mod_rewrite is enabled in Hostinger
- **Alternative**: Contact Hostinger support to enable it

## ðŸ”§ **Step 6: Alternative Upload Method (FTP)**

If File Manager doesn't work, use FTP:

### 6.1 FTP Settings (from Hostinger)
- **Host**: Your domain or IP
- **Username**: Your FTP username
- **Password**: Your FTP password
- **Port**: 21

### 6.2 Upload with FileZilla
1. Download FileZilla (free FTP client)
2. Connect using your Hostinger FTP credentials
3. Navigate to `public_html` folder
4. Upload all files maintaining directory structure

## ðŸ”§ **Step 7: Emergency Fix**

If nothing works, try this emergency approach:

### 7.1 Disable .htaccess Temporarily
1. In File Manager, rename `.htaccess` to `.htaccess.backup`
2. Test if images show
3. If they work, the issue is in .htaccess configuration

### 7.2 Contact Hostinger Support
If images still don't work:
1. Contact Hostinger support
2. Ask them to:
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify mod_rewrite is enabled
   - Check server error logs
